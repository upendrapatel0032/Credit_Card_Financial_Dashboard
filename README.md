💳 Credit Card Financial Dashboard | Power BI & SQL
👋 About This Project

This project demonstrates my ability to convert raw financial data into meaningful business insights using SQL and Power BI.
It is an end-to-end analytics project, covering data ingestion, modeling, analysis, and visualization — exactly how real-world BI teams work.

The dashboard helps stakeholders monitor weekly performance, revenue growth, customer behavior, and risk metrics in a clear and interactive way.
